Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"

I thought it was pretty deep when he said that science gives us the ability to see what our human eyes cannot.

The universe is so big. We are so small.

Now I'm confused about light and time and stuff. If the universe is moving away from us, but light is moving toward us (at the speed of light), then light from further away also takes longer to reach us, then what's at the end of the observable universe? I've seen pictures of the background radiation but shouldn't it appear closer to us since the universe is expanding? Or is it already close?

When did the big bang end if the universe is still expanding? How can it expand if it's the very definition of space? Is it?

That crocodile-looking thing was pretty sexy.

I wonder when the last person on Earth will forget about me. (I think someone had a quote about this, that you die twice.)

The benefits of pattern recognition certainly outweigh the drawbacks which we seem so focused on today.

Perhaps computers aren't their own thing, but just a more perfect human for their jobs.
^I don't know what that means, but that thought crossed my mind while I was watching, because of the pattern recognition thing.

I apologize to Mr. Oort for not caring about him.

40,000 generations of humans is a lot. I don't even know most of my great-grandparents.

See for yourself! Question authority! My friend from camp always said "Question your assumptions"

Are these major scientific advances worth it if it's still Newton's fault we have to take all these classes like calculus and stuff?

Stars are pretty. I wish we could see them here.
